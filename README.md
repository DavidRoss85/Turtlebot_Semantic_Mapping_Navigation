# Turtlebot Semantic Mapping and Navigation

## Continuation of school projects, merging semantic mapping and semantic navigation

### Semantic mapping:
This project focuses on building maps that have meaning.
- Normal occupancy grids do not usually contain information about what an obstacle is.
- By using visual object recognition and distance calculation we hope to place these items on a standard occupancy grid, giving context to obstacles.

### Semantic navigation
This focuses on autonomous navigation to predefined items
- Utilizing object recognition navigate to and stop within a specific distance of an object
