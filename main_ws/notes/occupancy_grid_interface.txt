# The map data, in row-major order, starting with (0,0).
# Cell (1, 0) will be listed second, representing the next cell in the x direction.
# Cell (0, 1) will be at the index equal to info.width, followed by (1, 1).
# The values inside are application dependent, but frequently,
# 0 represents unoccupied, 1 represents definitely occupied, and
# -1 represents unknown.
